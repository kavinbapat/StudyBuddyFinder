# Study Buddy Finer
This project was created by GitHub Classroom for the University of Virginia course Computer Science 3240. This Repository contains the Source Code of the Study Buddy Finder I created with my group.

The study buddy application is intended to facilitate connecting students in the same courses into one-off study session groups. This application implements a suite of chat features using Twilio and is based on technologies including Django, Bootstrap, and Python.
